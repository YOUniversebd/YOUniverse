    From birth, girls are subjected to discrimination. In many families, not being born a boy is considered a crime. 
    The family, society, and even her own mother—all teach her that <strong>"WOMEN have to put up with these."</strong> 
    But for how long? To what extent? If her husband raises his hand against her, should she still endure it? 
    While a boy is taught self-reliance, a girl is taught how to live in dependence. 
    This film highlights the social condition of women and the chains of subjugation they face. 
    After silent tears, eventually, a person raises their voice and speaks for their rights. 
    This film emphasizes the importance of speaking out against injustice and raising one's voice for their rights.

  <h2>Director Statement</h2>

  <p>
    Across the globe, many women and girls continue to face discrimination based on their sex and gender. 
    Gender inequality is the foundation of numerous challenges that disproportionately affect women—issues like domestic 
    and sexual violence, wage disparity, limited access to education, and inadequate healthcare. 
    These injustices are deeply rooted in societal norms and expectations that restrict women’s freedom and opportunities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through my film <strong>"WOMEN have to put up with these"</strong>, I aim to shed light on the ongoing struggle that women 
    face in a world that often teaches them to accept their subjugation. The story follows a woman who, from birth, is taught 
    that her gender is her burden. From her family’s disappointment over her being born a girl, to the abusive treatment she 
    endures in her marriage, she is caught in a cycle of helplessness. However, this film is not just about suffering; it is 
    about the importance of speaking up.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a society where silence has been normalized, the film calls for a voice—a voice that demands justice and equality. 
    It portrays how, after years of silence, one can find the courage to challenge the status quo. 
    My hope is that this film resonates with viewers, sparking a conversation about the need to break the chains of gender 
    inequality, not only for women but for society as a whole. 
    It is my little attempt to highlight the struggles of women, but also to show the power of defiance and resilience.
