  <p>A story about women's struggle and the courage to speak up for their rights.</p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>
      From birth, girls are subjected to discrimination. In many families, not being born a boy is considered a crime.
      The family, society, and even her own mother—all teach her that <strong>“WOMEN have to put up with these.”</strong>
      But for how long? To what extent? If her husband raises his hand against her, should she still endure it?
      While a boy is taught self-reliance, a girl is taught how to live in dependence.
    </p>

    <p>
      This film highlights the social condition of women and the chains of subjugation they face.
      After silent tears, eventually, a person raises their voice and speaks for their rights.
      It emphasizes the importance of speaking out against injustice and raising one's voice for their dignity.
    </p>

    <h2>Director’s Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Across the globe, many women and girls continue to face discrimination based on their gender.
      Gender inequality is the root of countless injustices — domestic violence, wage disparity,
      limited access to education, and healthcare. These are built into societal norms that restrict
      women’s freedom and opportunities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through my film <strong>“WOMEN have to put up with these,”</strong> I wanted to portray the quiet endurance
      that society normalizes for women — and the power of finding one’s voice after years of silence.
      It’s not just a film about pain; it’s about the courage to resist and reclaim agency.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Silence can be heavy, but one raised voice can start an echo of change.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Production Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This short film was shot entirely on a mobile phone with a symbolic, minimalist approach.
      The visuals focus on emotion and reality — using available light and raw performance
      to preserve authenticity. Despite its micro budget, the film’s strength lies in truth and empathy.
