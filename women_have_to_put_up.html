  <h1>WOMEN have to put up with these</h1>
  <p><em>‚Äú‡¶Æ‡ßá‡ßü‡ßá‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶è‡¶∏‡¶¨ ‡¶∏‡¶π‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶π‡ßü‚Äù ‚Äî a short film on gender inequality, abuse, and resilience.</em></p>

  <img src="images/women_film_still.jpg" alt="WOMEN have to put up with these" style="width:100%; border-radius:10px; margin:20px 0;">

  <p>From birth, girls are subjected to discrimination. In many families, not being born a boy is considered a crime. The family, society, and even her own mother‚Äîall teach her that ‚Äúwomen have to put up with these.‚Äù But for how long? To what extent? If her husband raises his hand against her, should she still endure it?</p>

  <p>While a boy is taught self-reliance, a girl is taught how to live in dependence. This film highlights the social condition of women and the chains of subjugation they face. After silent tears, eventually, a person raises their voice and speaks for their rights. This film emphasizes the importance of speaking out against injustice and raising one‚Äôs voice for their rights.</p>

  <h3>Director‚Äôs Statement</h3>
  <p>Across the globe, many women and girls continue to face discrimination based on their sex and gender. Gender inequality is the foundation of numerous challenges that disproportionately affect women‚Äîissues like domestic and sexual violence, wage disparity, limited access to education, and inadequate healthcare. These injustices are deeply rooted in societal norms and expectations that restrict women‚Äôs freedom and opportunities.</p>

  <p>Through my film <strong>‚ÄúWOMEN have to put up with these‚Äù</strong>, I aim to shed light on the ongoing struggle that women face in a world that often teaches them to accept their subjugation. The story follows a woman who, from birth, is taught that her gender is her burden. From her family‚Äôs disappointment over her being born a girl, to the abusive treatment she endures in her marriage, she is caught in a cycle of helplessness. However, this film is not just about suffering; it is about the importance of speaking up.</p>

  <p>In a society where silence has been normalized, the film calls for a voice‚Äîa voice that demands justice and equality. It portrays how, after years of silence, one can find the courage to challenge the status quo. My hope is that this film resonates with viewers, sparking a conversation about the need to break the chains of gender inequality, not only for women but for society as a whole. It is my little attempt to highlight the struggles of women, but also to show the power of defiance and resilience.</p>
