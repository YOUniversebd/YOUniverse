      <p>Story</p>
      <p>Although the tree has life, they cannot speak. But since there is life, there must be a feeling of pain in the tree. Trees are useful friends of human beings. Trees give people flowers, fruits, crops, oxygen and shade, even the role of trees in disaster management is undeniable. But in return, we give them unbearable pain. We destroy trees for no reason; wound them with nails and other sharp things. By cutting down trees mercilessly for our own benefits we actually reveal our own selfishness and unscrupulousness. People can express their feelings immediately if they are hurt for any reason. But they do not understand the pain of the tree. The scream of the tree disappear into the thin air as they cannot protest like human being. Therefore, this short film is a small attempt to portray the silent cry of the tree called ‘Silent Sorrow’.</p>
